This website uses:<br>
  - Node.js: Used to run the backend server outside the browser.
  - Express: Web framework for Node.js that helps create routes and handle HTTP requests easily.
  - Dotenv – Loads environment variables from my .env file to keep sensitive data (API key) secure and out of the codebase.
  - CORS – Allows my frontend (Hosted on Vercel) to communicate with the backend (Hosted on Render).

### :arrow_forward: About
Moo-dy was created by ![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0894beaf-f587-4d0a-983a-caf7fb551554) <strong>JEAN JUSTEN</strong> as an object of study. My goal was to integrate frontend with backend, learn about endpoints, API Calls and update the DOM content with the Json response.
